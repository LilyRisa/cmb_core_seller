**Consolidated Reference** — Getting Started, Key Concepts, Workflow Diagram, and Merchant Integration Guide for the FBT Inbound and Goods Creation APIs.

## 1\. Overview

The **FBT Inbound API** suite enables sellers and logistics partners to programmatically create, manage, and track inbound shipments to TikTok's **Fulfillment by TikTok (FBT)** warehouses.

### New API Capabilities

FBT is launching **2 new API groups** alongside the existing APIs (which already support inventory search, inbound search, and inventory records).  
**① Create Inbound**  
End-to-end workflow to ship inventory into FBT warehouses:

-   Create an inbound plan & placement selection
-   Confirm shipping method & review requirements
-   Pack & ship — submit carton or unit manifest
-   Get shipping labels & update carrier tracking
-   Manage & cancel inbound orders as needed

→ Covered by **Carton Splitting** & **Unit Splitting**  
**② Create & Match Goods**  
Manage the FBT goods catalog and bind TikTok Shop SKUs:

-   Check hazmat & expiration requirements per SKU
-   Create FBT goods records and bind to Shop SKUs
-   Update goods info (dimensions, barcodes, hazmat)
-   Manage SKU-to-goods bindings (bind / unbind)

→ Covered by **Goods Management**

### Two Inbound Workflows Supported

**Carton Splitting**

-   Inventory is pre-packed into cartons before inbound creation and shipping
-   Each carton contains one or more SKUs
-   TikTok assigns warehouse per carton

**Unit Splitting**

-   Inventory is not packed at time of inbound creation, packing information is shared later during ship step
    
-   Higher flexibility for flow based packing
    

**Required Auth Scope**: `seller.fbt.inbound` — all endpoints in both workflows require this scope on the seller access token.

## 2\. Key Concepts

Core terminology for FBT API integration.

### Merchant

A **Merchant** represents an entity that offers products or services for sale in TikTok Shop with FBT fulfillment. Every merchant has a unique **FBT Merchant ID**, required before any API calls can be made.

> **Getting your Merchant ID**: Merchant IDs are assigned during FBT onboarding. Use **Get FBT Merchant Onboarded Regions** to verify a seller is registered and retrieve their active regions before calling any inbound APIs.

### Goods

**FBT Goods** is a unique record assigned by FBT to track and manage an individual seller's inventory within the Fulfilled by TikTok system.  
Goods must be **matched to a TikTok product ID** before merchants can create inbound shipments, manage inventory, or fulfill orders. If goods are unmatched from SKUs, the corresponding inventory is no longer available for sale on TikTok Shop.  
**Key Terms**

| Full Name | Who Assigns It | Used In |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
TikTok Shop Product /SKU ID

 | 

TikTok Shop (from your product catalog)

 | 

CreateGoods, GetHazmatInfo, UpdateSkuRelation

 |
| 

FBT Goods ID

 | 

FBT system — returned on CreateGoods success

 | 

UpdateGoods, UpdateSkuRelation, Inbound APIs

 |
| 

**Goods Lifecycle**

 | 

 | 

 |

1.  **Check requirements** — call *Get Hazmat & Expiration Info* to determine special handling needs
2.  **Create & bind** — call *Create Goods* with `CREATE_AND_BIND` to create the FBT goods record and link it to a TikTok Shop SKU
3.  **Create inbound** — once matched, use the Inbound APIs to ship inventory
4.  **Manage bindings** — use *Update Goods SKU Relation* to add or remove SKU associations at any time

**Tip**: A single FBT Goods record can be bound to **multiple TikTok Shop SKUs (1:N)** when the merchant enables channel inventory — useful for selling the same physical product across multiple shops or regions.

### FBT Warehouse

FBT warehouses are **subscribed automatically after onboarding**. There are two warehouse types, each with a distinct role:

| Warehouse Type | Accepts Inbound | Fulfills Orders | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 
**HUB**

 | 

✅ Yes

 | 

❌ No

 | 

Inbound processing & sorting only — inventory is transferred to an FC before becoming sellable.  
Charges hub placement fees, refer to FBT [merchant academy](https://scm-us.tiktok.com/merchant-university/home) for fees details

 |
| 

**FC** (Fulfillment Center)

 | 

✅ Yes

 | 

✅ Yes

 | 

Receives inventory; used for order fulfillment.  
Merchants cannot select these manually, FBT placement decides FC.

 |
| 

Use **Get FBT Warehouse List** to retrieve all warehouse IDs, names, addresses, and types. The `warehouse_id` returned is required when creating an inbound plan.

 | 

 | 

 | 

 |

## 3\. Authentication

Every API request must include the following headers:

| Header | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
`content-type`

 | 

`application/json`

 | 

Required on all requests

 |
| 

`x-tts-access-token`

 | 

Your seller access token

 | 

Obtain via TikTok Shop OAuth (`user_type = 0`). **Tokens expire** — build refresh logic into your pipeline

 |
| 

**Example**

 | 

 | 

 |

HTTP

Word Wrap

```
POST /fbt/202602/create_update_inbound_plan?shop_id=123456 HTTP/1.1  
content-type: application/json  
x-tts-access-token: eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...
```

**Token Expiry**: Access tokens expire. Always check expiry time and refresh using the refresh token before making API calls in automated pipelines.

## 4\. Before You Start — Checklist

Confirm all of the following before making your first API call:

-    You have a valid **FBT Merchant ID** (assigned during FBT onboarding). Verify with *Get FBT Merchant Onboarded Regions*
    
-    Your TikTok Shop goods are **created and matched** to FBT via the Goods Management APIs or the FBT seller portal
    
-    You have a **seller access token** with the `seller.fbt.inbound` OAuth scope
    
-    You have decided between **Carton Splitting** (pre-packed boxes) and **Unit Splitting** (loose units)
    
-    You have decided between **Single\_Hub (Single Shipment)** and **D2FC (Multiple Shipments)** to FBT
    

## 5\. Create & Match Goods — API Overview

Before sending inventory to FBT, sellers must have **FBT Goods records created and matched** to their TikTok Shop SKUs. These APIs should typically be called **before** creating an inbound plan.

## 6\. Choose Your Inbound Workflow

| Criteria | Carton Splitting | Unit Splitting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
**When to use**

 | 

You know carton dimensions & contents before shipping

 | 

You have not packed cartons at time of inbound order creation, or cartons are packed dynamically by your warehouse

 |
| 

**inbound\_type value**

 | 

`CARTON_SPLITTING`

 | 

`UNIT_SPLITTING`

 |
| 

**Carton data in payload**

 | 

Required — at plan creation;

 | 

Not required, has to be provided later at Ship IBR step

## 7\. Create Inbound — API Call Sequence

Follow these **9 steps in order**. Each step may produce IDs required by the next step. Both workflows (Carton / Unit) share this same sequence — the only differences are in request/response fields.

| # | API | Method | Purpose | Key Output | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 
1

 | 

**Create / Update Inbound Plan**

 | 

POST

FBT Inbound method

 |
| 

3

 | 

**Get Inbound Method Detail**

 | 

POST

 | 

Get details for each inbound method and ETA, including placement option id and warehouse id.  
For hubs it also includes placement fee estimate.

 | 

`placement_option_id`  
If you want to go to a specific hub, please use the correct placement option id corresponding to the hub.

 | 

**Async polling operation**: This endpoint may take up to **3-5 seconds** to return success.  
We recommend polling every 3-5 seconds until placement task is successful  

 |
| 

4

 | 

**Confirm Inbound Method**

 | 

 |
| 

5

 | 

**Ship Inbound Order**

 | 

POST

 | 

Submit final shipment details: carton/unit manifest, carton contents if unit split  

 | 

`inbound_order_id` status changes to "shipped"

 | 

This is required to receive inventory. Inbound orders that have not been shipped will result in NCI

 | 

 | 

 | 

 | 

 |

### `plan_id` — Create vs Update

| Scenario | `plan_id` in request body |
| --- | --- |
| 
Creating a new inbound plan

 | 

**Omit** — the system generates and returns a new `inbound_plan_id`

 |
| 

Updating an existing draft plan

 | 

**Required** — include the `inbound_plan_id` returned from the original create call

 |

### Timestamp— Format

All `timestamp` fields inside request parameters must be a **Unix timestamp in seconds (UTC)**:

JSON

Word Wrap

```
{
  "cartons": [
    {
      "items": [
        {
          "tts_goods_id": "9988776655",
          "quantity": 10,
          "expiration_timestamp": "1780000000"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> Use seconds (UTC), **not milliseconds**.

## 8\. Error Handling

### HTTP Error Codes

-   **400 Bad Request** — Validate all required fields and data types before submission
-   **401 Unauthorized** — Token expired or missing. Refresh and retry
-   **409 Conflict** — Duplicate plan/order. Check `idempotency_key` or existing records
-   **429 Rate Limited** — Implement exponential backoff with jitter. Default limit: **10 req/sec per shop**
-   **5xx Server Error** — Retry with backoff (max 3 retries). Log `request_id` from response headers for escalation

### Common Issues & Fixes

**ETA slot unavailable.** ETA helps FBT plan warehouse inbound capacity. \*\*\*\* During peak some inbound methods or sites might not be available, please select a different ETA

-   Retrieve available ETAs from *Get Inbound Method Detail* (Step 3) and pick from that list

**Generic "Internal Error" on Create Inbound Plan:** Try the following steps

-   Verify your goods are matched to TikTok Shop SKUs (unmatched goods cannot be inbounded)
-   If it persists, escalate with full request payload and `request_id` from the response header

**Print Label API delay** Label printing runs **asynchronously** after print label API call.

## 11\. FAQs

### Inbound Method Values

**Q: What do D2FC and ONE\_HUB mean in ListAvailableInboundMethod response?**

-   **D2FC**: *Direct to Fulfillment Center* — your shipment goes directly to the final FC that fulfills customer orders
-   **ONE\_HUB**: Your shipment is first sent to a hub/consolidation point for sorting, then forwarded to the FCThese are the two standard values; additional region-specific values may be available depending on the warehouse location.

**Q: Can I update the tracking number after submission?​**Yes — use the *Update Tracking* API to push a new or corrected carrier tracking number at any time after handing off to the carrier.
